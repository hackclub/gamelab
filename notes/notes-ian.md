- if there's a sprite you want to edit, there aren't a lot of options
  - no animation atm-- & not sure how to do it
  - scratch has "costumes" for animation
- changing the size of the sprite felt kinda advanced
  - using a sprite for a background felt hacky
- ian was guessing and checking a lot while coding
  - to make the bird go to a certain point, ian would increment values b/c he didn't notice the mouse position in the corner
- since the call, ian tested the engine while adding the drag-and-drop feature
- ian would use it again to make stuff
- ian hasn't done game-dev before & feels like he can use game-lab to get into it
- ian was working on a feature that would only share the game-- hide the editor
- ian has used Muse before
