- shift buttons up (run,save,github) -- i couldn't see them starting out
- add icons to different buttons
- use the hackclub theme & colors
- choose color for editor
- sharing link for playing + sharing link for editing
- project name should show (maybe heading of preview & `<title>` tags)
- what if the README/documentation was a game?
- docs should be accessible in the engine itself
- game-lab logo should be up at the top
- what's the name? what's the logo?
  - logo works similar to "powered by hcb"-- logo goes good with other stuff
- have a logo sprite & when sharing, the logo sprite loads first
- make error section clearer & less scary
  - use hack club red

- question: will it be good to run with just these things?
